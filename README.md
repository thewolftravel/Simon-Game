Simon Game
The Simon Game is a classic electronic memory game brought to the web. 
This project challenges players to test and enhance their memory skills by following a sequence of lights and sounds, gradually increasing in complexity.

Tech Stack
This project is built using a range of web technologies:

HTML: Providing the structure for the game interface.

CSS: Styling and enhancing the visual design.

JavaScript: Driving the game logic and interaction.

jQuery: Simplifying event handling and manipulation of the DOM (Document Object Model).

Features
The Simon Game project includes the following features:
Color Buttons: Represent the four colors (e.g., red, blue, green, yellow) players need to remember and replicate.

Sound Effects: Enhance the gaming experience by providing audio feedback for each button press.

Score Counter: Keeps track of the player's progress and success rate.

Strict Mode: An option that increases the game's difficulty by requiring the player to start from the beginning after a mistake.

Usage
To play the Simon Game, press any key on your keyboard to begin. 
Pay attention to the sequence of colors and sounds played by the game, and then use your mouse or touchpad to click the color buttons 
in the correct order to repeat the sequence. The game will become progressively more challenging as you succeed.
